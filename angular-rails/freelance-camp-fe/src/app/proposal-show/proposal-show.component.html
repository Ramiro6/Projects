			<p>Hi {{ proposal.customer }},</p>

			<p>It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review your projectrequirements, I believe it is a great fit for the types of applicationsthat I build out. Please feel free to check out some of my pastprojects <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}">here</a>.</p>

			<p>To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing {{proposal.tools }}, and a number of other tools to ensure that theproject follows industry wide best practices.</p>

			<p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, soin addition to incorporating everything that we discussed, I will alsobe creating a project management dashboard and sending you a projectupdate message daily so that you can have a transparent view of thedevelopment as it takes place.</p>

			<p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that wediscussed, I am estimating that it will take {{proposal.estimated_hours }} hours in development time to complete. Theproject should take {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to completeand with my hourly rate of {{ proposal.hourly_rate }}/hour, theestimated total will be {{ proposal.hourly_rate *proposal.estimated_hours }}.</p>


			<p>The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize theproject and sign contracts.</p>

			<p>I am excited to working with you and build out this project.</p>
